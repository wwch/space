INTRODUCING

Dogma is a truly minimalist WordPress theme, following all the ground rules of the minimalist web design ‘dogma’. It keeps every aspect of the design to a minimum:

1 single page design for every page, with the archive and links to other pages ever present
1 column
1 typeface in 1 color, 1 size and 2 weights
No 'homepage' in the classic sense
No header
No footer
No logo
No search functionality
No separate archive page
No date mention
No author name
No commenting

Just the articles.
